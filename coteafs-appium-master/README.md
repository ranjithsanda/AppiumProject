## Why to create yet-another Appium wrapper Framework?
* I couldn't find an easy-to-use framework which had underlying Appium when I started Mobile Automation.
* Also, it was not so easy to identify which capabilities to use for which devices.
* So I came up with this solution for myself and made it open source so everyone can benefit from it.
